# **Mi AI Button Remapper**

## Description

This Magisk module allows you to remap the dedicated Mi AI hardware button of
the Xiaomi Mi 9 and Mi Mix 3 to any one of 15 user-selectable functions.

The following functions are selectable during installation, using the hardware
keys of the phone:

* Camera
* Screenshot

To change the currently mapped function, simply reinstall the module, make a
new selection and reboot.

To restore the default Mi AI behaviour, simply deactivate or uninstall the
module and reboot.
